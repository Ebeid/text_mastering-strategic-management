        <h2 class="title editable block">Why Examine Generic Strategies?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p01">Business-level strategy addresses the question of how a firm will compete in a particular industry (<a class="xref" href="#ketchen_1.0-ch05_s01_f01">Figure 5.1 "Business-Level Strategies"</a>). This seems to be a simple question on the surface, but it is actually quite complex. The reason is that there are a great many possible answers to the question. Consider, for example, the restaurants in your town or city. Chances are that you live fairly close to some combination of McDonald’s, Subway, Chili’s, Applebee’s, Panera Bread Company, dozens of other national brands, and a variety of locally based eateries that have just one location. Each of these restaurants competes using a business model that is at least somewhat unique. When an executive in the restaurant industry analyzes her company and her rivals, she needs to avoid getting distracted by all the nuances of different firm’s business-level strategies and losing sight of the big picture.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p02">The solution is to think about business-level strategy in terms of generic strategies. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">generic strategy</a><span class="glossdef">A general way of positioning a firm’s business-level strategy within an industry.</span></span> is a general way of positioning a firm within an industry. Focusing on generic strategies allows executives to concentrate on the core elements of firms’ business-level strategies. The most popular set of generic strategies is based on the work of Professor Michael Porter of the Harvard Business School and subsequent researchers that have built on Porter’s initial ideas.<span class="footnote" id="ketchen_1.0-fn05_003">Porter, M. E. 1980. <em class="emphasis">Competitive strategy: Techniques for analyzing industries and competitors</em>. New York, NY: Free Press; Williamson, P. J., &amp; Zeng, M. 2009.

        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p03">According to Porter, two competitive dimensions are the keys to business-level strategy. The first dimension is a firm’s source of competitive advantage. This dimension involves whether a firm tries to gain an edge on rivals by keeping costs down or by offering something unique in the market. The second dimension is firms’ scope of operations. This dimension involves whether a firm tries to target customers in general or whether it seeks to attract just a segment of customers. Four generic business-level strategies emerge from these decisions: (1) cost leadership, (2) differentiation, (3) focused cost leadership, and (4) focused differentiation. In rare cases, firms are able to offer both low prices and unique features that customers find desirable. These firms are following a best-cost strategy. Firms that are not able to offer low prices or appealing unique features are referred to as “stuck in the middle.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p04">Understanding the differences that underlie generic strategies is important because different generic strategies offer different value propositions to customers. A firm focusing on cost leadership will have a different value chain configuration than a firm whose strategy focuses on differentiation. For example, marketing and sales for a differentiation strategy often requires extensive effort while some firms that follow cost leadership such as Waffle House are successful with limited marketing efforts. This chapter presents each generic strategy and the “recipe” generally associated with success when using that strategy. When firms follow these recipes, the result can be a strategy that leads to superior performance. But when firms fail to follow logical actions associated with each strategy, the result may be a value proposition configuration that is expensive to implement and that does not satisfy enough customers to be viable.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Limitations of Generic Strategies</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_p01">Examining business-level strategy in terms of generic strategies has limitations. Firms that follow a particular generic strategy tend to share certain features. For example, one way that cost leaders generally keep costs low is by not spending much on advertising. Not every cost leader, however, follows this path. While cost leaders such as Waffle House spend very little on advertising, Walmart spends considerable money on print and television advertising despite following a cost leadership strategy. Thus a firm may not match every characteristic that its generic strategy entails. Indeed, depending on the nature of a firm’s industry, tweaking the recipe of a generic strategy may be essential to cooking up success.</p>
