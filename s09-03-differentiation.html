        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s03_s01_p01">A famous cliché contends that “you get what you pay for.” This saying captures the essence of a differentiation strategy. A firm following a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">differentiation strategy</a><span class="glossdef">A generic positioning that attempts to convince customers to pay a premium price for its good or services by providing unique and desirable features.</span></span> attempts to convince customers to pay a premium price for its good or services by providing unique and desirable features (<a class="xref" href="#ketchen_1.0-ch05_s03_f01">Figure 5.4 "Differentiation"</a>). The message that such a firm conveys to customers is that you will pay a little bit more for our offerings, but you will receive a good value overall because our offerings provide something special.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s03_s01_p02">In terms of the two competitive dimensions described by Michael Porter, using a differentiation strategy means that a firm is competing based on uniqueness rather than price and is seeking to attract a broad market.<span class="footnote" id="ketchen_1.0-fn05_005">Porter, M. E. 1980. <em class="emphasis">Competitive strategy: Techniques for analyzing industries and competitors</em>. New York, NY: Free Press.</span> Coleman camping equipment offers a good example. If camping equipment such as sleeping bags, lanterns, and stoves fail during a camping trip, the result will be, well, unhappy campers. Coleman’s sleeping bags, lanterns, and stoves are renowned for their reliability and durability. Cheaper brands are much more likely to have problems. Lovers of the outdoors must pay more to purchase Coleman’s goods than they would to obtain lesser brands, but having equipment that you can count on to keep you warm and dry is worth a price premium in the minds of most campers.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s03_s01_p03">Successful use of a differentiation strategy depends on not only offering unique features but also communicating the value of these features to potential customers. As a result, advertising in general and brand building in particular are important to this strategy. Few goods are more basic and generic than table salt. This would seemingly make creating a differentiated brand in the salt business next to impossible. Through clever marketing, however, Morton Salt has done so. Morton has differentiated its salt by building a brand around its iconic umbrella girl and its trademark slogan of “When it rains, it pours.” Would the typical consumer be able to tell the difference between Morton Salt and cheaper generic salt in a blind taste test? Not a chance. Yet Morton succeeds in convincing customers to pay a little extra for its salt through its brand-building efforts.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s03_s01_p04">FedEx and Nike are two other companies that have done well at communicating to customers that they provide differentiated offerings. FedEx’s former slogan “When it absolutely, positively has to be there overnight” highlights the commitment to speedy delivery that sets the firm apart from competitors such as UPS and the US Postal Service. Nike differentiates its athletic shoes and apparel through its iconic “swoosh” logo as well as an intense emphasis on product innovation through research and development.</p>

    <div class="section" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s03_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Advantages and Disadvantages of Differentiation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_p01">Each generic strategy offers advantages that firms can potentially leverage to enjoy strong performance, as well as disadvantages that may damage their performance. In the case of differentiation, a key advantage is that effective differentiation creates an ability to obtain premium prices from customers (<a class="xref" href="#ketchen_1.0-ch05_s03_s01_f01">Figure 5.5 "Executing a Differentiation Strategy"</a>). This enables a firm to enjoy strong profit margins. Coca-Cola, for example, currently enjoys a profit margin of approximately 33 percent, meaning that about thirty-three cents of every dollar it collects from customers is profit. In comparison, Walmart’s cost leadership strategy delivered a margin of under 4 percent in 2010.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_p02">In turn, strong margins mean that the firm does not need to attract huge numbers of customers to have a good overall level of profit. Luckily for Coca-Cola, the firm does attract a great many buyers. Overall, the firm made a profit of just under $12 billion on sales of just over $35 billion in 2010. Interestingly, Walmart’s profits were only 25 percent higher ($15 billion) than Coca-Cola’s while its sales volume ($421 billion) was twelve times as large as Coca-Cola’s.<span class="footnote" id="ketchen_1.0-fn05_007">Profit statistics drawn from Standard &amp; Poor’s stock reports on Coca-Cola and Walmart.</span> This comparison of profit margins and overall profit levels illustrates why a differentiation strategy is so attractive to many firms.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_p03">To the extent that differentiation remains in place over time, buyer loyalty may be created. Loyal customers are very desirable because they are not <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">price sensitive</a><span class="glossdef">The extent to which a price increase makes a buyer less likely to purchase an item.</span></span>. In other words, buyer loyalty makes a customer unlikely to switch to another firm’s products if that firm tries to steal the customer away through lower prices. Many soda drinkers are fiercely loyal to Coca-Cola’s products. Coca-Cola’s headquarters are in Atlanta, and loyalty to the firm is especially strong in Georgia and surrounding states. Pepsi and other brands have a hard time convincing loyal Coca-Cola fans to buy their beverages, even when offering deep discounts. This helps keep Coca-Cola’s profits high because the firm does not have to match any promotions that its rivals launch to keep its customers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_p04">Meanwhile, Pepsi also has attracted a large set of brand-loyal customers that Coca-Cola struggles to steal. This enhances Pepsi’s profits. In contrast, store-brand sodas such as Sam’s Choice (which is sold at Walmart) seldom attract loyalty. As a result, they must be offered at very low prices to move from store shelves into shopping carts.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_p05">Beyond existing competitors, a differentiation strategy also creates benefits relative to potential new entrants. Specifically, the brand loyalty that customers feel to a differentiated product makes it difficult for a new entrant to lure these customers to adopt its product. A new soda brand, for example, would struggle to take customers away from Coca-Cola or Pepsi. Thus a differentiation strategy helps create barriers to entry that protect the firm and its industry from new competition.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_p06">The big risk when using a differentiation strategy is that customers will not be willing to pay extra to obtain the unique features that a firm is trying to build its strategy around. In 2007, department store Dillard’s stopped carrying men’s sportswear made by Nautica because the seafaring theme of Nautica’s brand had lost much of its cache among many men.<span class="footnote" id="ketchen_1.0-fn05_008">Kapner, S. 2007, November 1. Nautica brand losing ground. <em class="emphasis">CNNMoney</em>. Retrieved from http://money.cnn.com/2007/10/31/news/companies/Kapner_Nautica.fortune/index.htm</span> Because Nautica’s uniqueness had eroded, Dillard’s believed that space in its stores that Nautica had been occupying could be better allocated to other brands.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_p07">In some cases, customers may simply prefer a cheaper alternative. For example, products that imitate the look and feel of offerings from Ray-Ban, Tommy Bahama, and Coach are attractive to many value-conscious consumers. Firms such as these must work hard at product development and marketing to ensure that enough customers are willing to pay a premium for their goods rather than settling for knockoffs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_p08">In other cases, customers desire the unique features that a firm offers, but competitors are able to imitate the features well enough that they are no longer unique. If this happens, customers have no reason to pay a premium for the firm’s offerings. IBM experienced the pain of this scenario when executives tried to follow a differentiation strategy in the personal computer market. The strategy had worked for IBM in other areas. Specifically, IBM had enjoyed a great deal of success in the mainframe computer market by providing superior service and charging customers a premium for their mainframes. A business owner who relied on a mainframe to run her company could not afford to have her mainframe out of operation for long. Meanwhile, few businesses had the skills to fix their own mainframes. IBM’s message to customers was that they would pay more for IBM’s products but that this was a good investment because when a mainframe needed repairs, IBM would provide faster and better service than its competitors could. The customer would thus be open for business again very quickly after a mainframe failure.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_p09">This positioning failed when IBM used it in the personal computer market. Rivals such as Dell were able to offer service that was just as good as IBM’s while also charging lower prices for personal computers than IBM charged. From a customer’s perspective, a person would be foolish to pay more for an IBM personal computer since IBM did not offer anything unique. IBM steadily lost market share as a result. By 2005, IBM’s struggles led it to sell its personal computer business to Lenovo. The firm is still successful, however, within the mainframe market where its offerings remain differentiated.</p>
