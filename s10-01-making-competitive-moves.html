        <h2 class="title editable block">Being a First Mover: Advantages and Disadvantages</h2>

        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch06_s01_s01_p01">A famous cliché contends that “the early bird gets the worm.” Applied to the business world, the cliché suggests that certain benefits are available to a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">first mover</a><span class="glossdef">An initial entrant into a market.</span></span> into a market that will not be available to later entrants (<a class="xref" href="#ketchen_1.0-ch06_s01_f01">Figure 6.1 "Making Competitive Moves"</a>). A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">first-mover advantage</a><span class="glossdef">When the initial move into a market allows a firm to establish a dominant position that other firms struggle to overcome.</span></span> exists when making the initial move into a market allows a firm to establish a dominant position that other firms struggle to overcome (<a class="xref" href="#ketchen_1.0-ch06_s01_s01_f01">Figure 6.2 "First Mover Advantage"</a>). For example, Apple’s creation of a user-friendly, small computer in the early 1980s helped fuel a reputation for creativity and innovation that persists today. Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) was able to develop a strong bond with Chinese officials by being the first Western restaurant chain to enter China. Today, KFC is the leading Western fast-food chain in this rapidly growing market. Genentech’s early development of biotechnology allowed it to overcome many of the pharmaceutical industry’s traditional entry barriers (such as financial capital and distribution networks) and become a profitable firm. Decisions to be first movers helped all three firms to be successful in their respective industries.<span class="footnote" id="ketchen_1.0-fn06_003">This section draws from Ketchen, D. J., Snow, C., &amp; Street, V. 2004. Improving firm performance by matching strategic decision making processes to competitive dynamics. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Executive</em>, <em class="emphasis">19</em>(4), 29–43.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch06_s01_s01_p02">On the other hand, a first mover cannot be sure that customers will embrace its offering, making a first move inherently risky. Apple’s attempt to pioneer the personal digital assistant market, through its Newton, was a financial disaster. The first mover also bears the costs of developing the product and educating customers. Others may learn from the first mover’s successes and failures, allowing them to cheaply copy or improve the product. In creating the Palm Pilot, for example, 3Com was able to build on Apple’s earlier mistakes. Matsushita often refines consumer electronic products, such as compact disc players and projection televisions, after Sony or another first mover establishes demand. In many industries, knowledge diffusion and public-information requirements make such imitation increasingly easy.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch06_s01_s01_p03">One caution is that first movers must be willing to commit sufficient resources to follow through on their pioneering efforts. RCA and Westinghouse were the first firms to develop active-matrix LCD display technology, but their executives did not provide the resources needed to sustain the products spawned by this technology. Today, these firms are not even players in this important business segment that supplies screens for notebook computers, camcorders, medical instruments, and many other products.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch06_s01_s01_p04">To date, the evidence is mixed regarding whether being a first mover leads to success. One research study of 1,226 businesses over a fifty-five-year period found that first movers typically enjoy an advantage over rivals for about a decade, but other studies have suggested that first moving offers little or no advantages.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch06_s01_s01_p05">Perhaps the best question that executives can ask themselves when deciding whether to be a first mover is, how likely is this move to provide my firm with a sustainable competitive advantage? First moves that build on strategic resources such as patented technology are difficult for rivals to imitate and thus are likely to succeed. For example, Pfizer enjoyed a monopoly in the erectile dysfunction market for five years with its patented drug Viagra before two rival products (Cialis and Levitra) were developed by other pharmaceutical firms. Despite facing stiff competition, Viagra continues to raise about $1.9 billion in sales for Pfizer annually.<span class="footnote" id="ketchen_1.0-fn06_004">Figures from Standard &amp; Poor’s stock report on Pfizer.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch06_s01_s01_p06">In contrast, E-Trade Group’s creation in 2003 of the portable mortgage seemed doomed to fail because it did not leverage strategic resources. This innovation allowed customers to keep an existing mortgage when they move to a new home. Bigger banks could easily copy the portable mortgage if it gained customer acceptance, undermining E-Trade’s ability to profit from its first move.</p>

    <div class="section" id="ketchen_1.0-ch06_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Disruptive Innovation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch06_s01_s02_p01">Some firms have the opportunity to shake up their industry by introducing a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">disruptive innovation</a><span class="glossdef">An improvement that conflicts with, and threatens to replace, traditional approaches to competing within an industry.</span></span>—an innovation that conflicts with, and threatens to replace, traditional approaches to competing within an industry (<a class="xref" href="#ketchen_1.0-ch06_s01_s02_f01">Figure 6.3 "Shaking the Market with Disruptive Innovations"</a>). The iPad has proved to be a disruptive innovation since its introduction by Apple in 2010. Many individuals quickly abandoned clunky laptop computers in favor of the sleek tablet format offered by the iPad. And as a first mover, Apple was able to claim a large share of the market.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch06_s01_s02_p02">The iPad story is unusual, however. Most disruptive innovations are not overnight sensations. Typically, a small group of customers embrace a disruptive innovation as early adopters and then a critical mass of customers builds over time. An example is digital cameras. Few photographers embraced digital cameras initially because they took pictures slowly and offered poor picture quality relative to traditional film cameras. As digital cameras have improved, however, they have gradually won over almost everyone that takes pictures. Executives who are deciding whether to pursue a disruptive innovation must first make sure that their firm can sustain itself during an initial period of slow growth.</p>

    <div class="section" id="ketchen_1.0-ch06_s01_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Footholds</h2>

        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch06_s01_s03_p01">In warfare, many armies establish small positions in geographic territories that they have not occupied previously. These footholds provide value in at least two ways (<a class="xref" href="#ketchen_1.0-ch06_s01_s03_f01">Figure 6.4 "Footholds"</a>). First, owning a foothold can dissuade other armies from attacking in the region. Second, owning a foothold gives an army a quick strike capability in a territory if the army needs to expand its reach.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch06_s01_s03_p02">Similarly, some organizations find it valuable to establish footholds in certain markets. Within the context of business, a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">foothold</a><span class="glossdef">A small position that a firm intentionally establishes within a market in which it does not yet compete.</span></span> is a small position that a firm intentionally establishes within a market in which it does not yet compete.<span class="footnote" id="ketchen_1.0-fn06_005">Upson, J., Ketchen, D. J., Connelly, B., &amp; Ranft, A. Forthcoming. Competitor analysis and foothold moves. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Journal</em>.</span> Swedish furniture seller IKEA is a firm that relies on footholds. When IKEA enters a new country, it opens just one store. This store is then used as a showcase to establish IKEA’s brand. Once IKEA gains brand recognition in a country, more stores are established.<span class="footnote" id="ketchen_1.0-fn06_006">Hambrick, D. C., &amp; Fredrickson, J. W. 2005. Are you sure you have a strategy? <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Executive</em>, <em class="emphasis">19</em>, 51–62.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch06_s01_s03_p03">Pharmaceutical giants such as Merck often obtain footholds in emerging areas of medicine. In December 2010, for example, Merck purchased SmartCells Inc., a company that was developing a possible new treatment for diabetes. In May 2011, Merck acquired an equity stake in BeiGene Ltd., a Chinese firm that was developing novel cancer treatments and detection methods. Competitive moves such as these offer Merck relatively low-cost platforms from which it can expand if clinical studies reveal that the treatments are effective.</p>

Instead of trying to outmaneuver its competition, a firm using a blue ocean strategy tries to make the competition irrelevant (<a class="xref" href="#ketchen_1.0-ch06_s01_s04_f01">Figure 6.5 "Blue Ocean Strategy"</a>). Baseball legend Wee Willie Keeler offered a similar idea when asked how to become a better hitter: “Hit ’em where they ain’t.” In other words, hit the baseball where there are no fielders rather than trying to overwhelm the fielders with a ball hit directly at them.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch06_s01_s04_p03">Nintendo openly acknowledges following a blue ocean strategy in its efforts to invent new markets. In 2006, Perrin Kaplan, Nintendo’s vice president of marketing and corporate affairs for Nintendo of America noted in an interview, “We’re making games that are expanding our base of consumers in Japan and America. Yes, those who’ve always played games are still playing, but we’ve got people who’ve never played to start loving it with titles like <em class="emphasis">Nintendogs</em>, <em class="emphasis">Animal Crossing</em> and <em class="emphasis">Brain Games</em>. These games are blue ocean in action.”<span class="footnote" id="ketchen_1.0-fn06_008">Rosmarin, R. 2006, February 7. Nintendo’s new look. Forbes.com.

        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch06_s01_s05_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Bricolage</a><span class="glossdef">Using whatever materials and resources happen to be available as the inputs into a creative process.</span></span> is a concept that is borrowed from the arts and that, like blue ocean strategy, stresses moves that create new markets. Bricolage means using whatever materials and resources happen to be available as the inputs into a creative process. A good example is offered by one of the greatest inventions in the history of civilization: the printing press. As noted in the <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, “The printing press is a classic combinatorial innovation. Each of its key elements—the movable type, the ink, the paper and the press itself—had been developed separately well before Johannes Gutenberg printed his first Bible in the 15th century. Movable type, for instance, had been independently conceived by a Chinese blacksmith named Pi Sheng four centuries earlier. The press itself was adapted from a screw press that was being used in Germany for the mass production of wine.”<span class="footnote" id="ketchen_1.0-fn06_009">Johnson, S.

Coming to the rescue is Belly Couture, a boutique in Lubbock, Texas, that combines stylish fashion and maternity clothes. The store’s clever slogan—“Motherhood is haute”—reflects the unique niche it fills through bricolage. A wilder example is TURISAS, a Finnish rock band that has created a niche for itself by combining heavy metal music with the imagery and costumes of Vikings. The band’s website describes their effort at bricolage as “inspirational cinematic battle metal brilliance.”<span class="footnote" id="ketchen_1.0-fn06_011"><a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.turisas.com/site/biography/">http://www.turisas.com/site/biography/</a></span> No one ever claimed that rock musicians are humble.</p>

            <p class="para" id="ketchen_1.0-ch06_s01_s05_p04">Competitive moves are chosen within executive suites, but they are implemented by frontline employees. Organizational success thus depends just as much on workers such as salespeople excelling in their roles as it does on executives’ ability to master strategy. A good illustration is provided in the 2010 film <em class="emphasis">Love and Other Drugs</em>, which was based on the nonfiction book <em class="emphasis">Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman</em>.</p>
            <p class="para" id="ketchen_1.0-ch06_s01_s05_p05">As a new sales representative for drug giant Pfizer, Jamie Randall believed that the best way to increase sales of Pfizer’s antidepressant Zoloft in his territory was to convince highly respected physician Dr. Knight to prescribe Zoloft rather than the good doctor’s existing preference, Ely Lilly’s drug Prozac. Once Dr. Knight began prescribing Zoloft, thought Randall, many other physicians in the area would follow suit.</p>
            <p class="para" id="ketchen_1.0-ch06_s01_s05_p06">This straightforward plan proved more difficult to execute than Randall suspected. Sales reps from Ely Lilly and other pharmaceutical firms aggressively pushed their firm’s products, such as by providing all-expenses-paid trips to Hawaii for nurses in Dr. Knight’s office. Prozac salesman Trey Hannigan went so far as to beat up Randall after finding out that Randall had stolen and destroyed Prozac samples. While assault is an extreme measure to defend a sales territory, the actions of Hannigan and the other salespeople depicted in <em class="emphasis">Love and Other Drugs</em> reflect the challenges that frontline employees face when implementing executives’ strategic decisions about competitive moves.</p>
