    <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s04_p01">Companies that use a cost leadership strategy and those that use a differentiation strategy share one important characteristic: both groups try to be attractive to customers in general. These efforts to appeal to broad markets can be contrasted with strategies that involve targeting a relatively narrow niche of potential customers. These latter strategies are known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">focus strategies</a><span class="glossdef">Generic business approaches that involve targeting a relatively narrow niche of potential customers.</span></span>.<span class="footnote" id="ketchen_1.0-fn05_009">Porter, M.

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Nature of the Focus Cost Leadership Strategy</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s04_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Focused cost leadership</a><span class="glossdef">A generic business strategy that requires competing based on price to target a narrow market.</span></span> is the first of two focus strategies. A focused cost leadership strategy requires competing based on price to target a narrow market (<a class="xref" href="#ketchen_1.0-ch05_s04_f01">Figure 5.6 "Focused Cost Leadership"</a>). A firm that follows this strategy does not necessarily charge the lowest prices in the industry. Instead, it charges low prices relative to other firms that compete within the target market. Redbox, for example, uses vending machines placed outside grocery stores and other retail outlets to rent DVDs of movies for $1. There are ways to view movies even cheaper, such as through the flat-fee streaming video subscriptions offered by Netflix. But among firms that rent actual DVDs, Redbox offers unparalleled levels of low price and high convenience.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s04_s01_p02">Another important point is that the nature of the narrow target market varies across firms that use a focused cost leadership strategy. In some cases, the target market is defined by demographics. Claire’s, for example, seeks to appeal to young women by selling inexpensive jewelry, accessories, and ear piercings. Claire’s use of a focused cost leadership strategy has been very successful; the firm has more than three thousand locations and has stores in 95 percent of US shopping malls.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s04_s01_p03">In other cases, the target market is defined by the sales channel used to reach customers. Most pizza shops offer sit-down service, delivery, or both. In contrast, Papa Murphy’s sells pizzas that customers cook at home. Because these inexpensive pizzas are baked at home rather than in the store, the law allows Papa Murphy’s to accept food stamps as payment. This allows Papa Murphy’s to attract customers that might not otherwise be able to afford a prepared pizza. In contrast to most fast-food restaurants, Checkers Drive In is a drive-through-only operation. To serve customers quickly, each store has two drive-through lanes: one on either side of the building. Checkers saves money in a variety of ways by not offering indoor seating to its customers—Checkers’ buildings are cheaper to construct, its utility costs are lower, and fewer employees are needed. These savings allow the firm to offer large burgers at very low prices and still remain profitable.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Nature of the Focused Differentiation Strategy</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s04_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Focused differentiation</a><span class="glossdef">A generic business strategy that requires offering unique features that fulfill the demands of a narrow market.</span></span> is the second of two focus strategies. A focused differentiation strategy requires offering unique features that fulfill the demands of a narrow market (<a class="xref" href="#ketchen_1.0-ch05_s04_s01_f01">Figure 5.7 "Focused Differentiation"</a>). As with a focused low-cost strategy, narrow markets are defined in different ways in different settings. Some firms using a focused differentiation strategy concentrate their efforts on a particular sales channel, such as selling over the Internet only. Others target particular demographic groups. One example is Breezes Resorts, a company that caters to couples without children. The firm operates seven tropical resorts where vacationers are guaranteed that they will not be annoyed by loud and disruptive children.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s04_s02_p02">While a differentiation strategy involves offering unique features that appeal to a variety of customers, the need to satisfy the desires of a narrow market means that the pursuit of uniqueness is often taken to the proverbial “next level” by firms using a focused differentiation strategy. Thus the unique features provided by firms following a focused differentiation strategy are often specialized.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s04_s02_p03">When it comes to uniqueness, few offerings can top Kopi Luwak coffee beans. High-quality coffee beans often sell for $10 to $15 a pound. In contrast, Kopi Luwak coffee beans sell for hundreds of dollars per pound.<span class="footnote" id="ketchen_1.0-fn05_010"><a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.catsasscoffee.com/order3.html">http://www.catsasscoffee.com/order3.html</a></span> This price is driven by the rarity of the beans and their rather bizarre nature. As noted in a 2010 article in the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, these beans</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s04_s02_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s04_s02_p04">are found in the droppings of the civet, a nocturnal, furry, long-tailed catlike animal that prowls Southeast Asia’s coffee-growing lands for the tastiest, ripest coffee cherries. The civet eventually excretes the hard, indigestible innards of the fruit—essentially, incipient coffee beans—though only after they have been fermented in the animal’s stomach acids and enzymes to produce a brew described as smooth, chocolaty and devoid of any bitter aftertaste.<span class="footnote" id="ketchen_1.0-fn05_011">Onishi, N. 2010, April 17. From dung to coffee brew with no aftertaste. <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>.

        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s04_s02_p05">Although many consumers consider Kopi Luwak to be disgusting, a relatively small group of coffee enthusiasts has embraced the coffee and made it a profitable product. This illustrates the essence of a focused differentiation strategy—effectively serving the specialized needs of a niche market can create great riches.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s04_s02_p06">Larger niches are served by Whole Foods Market and Mercedes-Benz. Although most grocery stores devote a section of their shelves to natural and organic products, Whole Foods Market works to sell such products exclusively. For customers, the large selection of organic goods comes at a steep price. Indeed, the supermarket’s reputation for high prices has led to a wry nickname—“Whole Paycheck”—but a sizable number of consumers are willing to pay a premium to feel better about the food they buy.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s04_s02_p07">The dedication of Mercedes-Benz to cutting-edge technology, styling, and safety innovations has made the firm’s vehicles prized by those who are rich enough to afford them. This appeal has existing for many decades. In 1970, acid-rocker Janis Joplin recorded a song called “Mercedes Benz” that highlighted the automaker’s allure. Since then Mercedes-Benz has used the song in several television commercials, including during the 2011 Super Bowl.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Advantages and Disadvantages of the Focused Strategies</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s04_s03_p01">Each generic strategy offers advantages that firms can potentially leverage to enhance their success as well as disadvantages that may undermine their success. In the case of focus differentiation, one advantage is that very high prices can be charged. Indeed, these firms often price their wares far above what is charged by firms following a differentiation strategy (<a class="xref" href="#ketchen_1.0-ch05_s04_s02_f01">Figure 5.8 "Executing a Focus Strategy"</a>). REI (Recreational Equipment Inc.), for example, commands a hefty premium for its outdoor sporting goods and clothes that feature name brands, such as The North Face and Marmot. Nat Nast’s focus differentiation strategy centers on selling men’s silk camp shirts with a 1950s retro flair. These shirts retail for more than $100. Focused cost leaders such as Checkers Drive In do not charge high prices like REI and Nat Nast do, but their low cost structures enable them to enjoy healthy profit margins.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s04_s03_p02">A second advantage of using a focus strategy is that firms often develop tremendous expertise about the goods and services that they offer. In markets such as camping equipment where product knowledge is important, rivals and new entrants may find it difficult to compete with firms following a focus strategy.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s04_s03_p03">In terms of disadvantages, the limited demand available within a niche can cause problems. First, a firm could find its growth ambitions stymied. Once its target market is being well served, expansion to other markets might be the only way to expand, and this often requires developing a new set of skills. Also, the niche could disappear or be taken over by larger competitors. Many gun stores have struggled and even gone out of business since Walmart and sporting goods stores such as Academy Sports and Bass Pro Shops have started carrying an impressive array of firearms.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch05_s04_s03_p04">Finally, damaging attacks may come not only from larger firms but also from smaller ones that adopt an even narrower focus. A sporting goods store that sells camping, hiking, kayaking, and skiing goods, for example, might lose business to a store that focuses solely on ski apparel because the latter can provide more guidance about how skiers can stay warm and avoid broken bones.</p>

That’s what fashion mogul Jacobim Mugatu was counting on in the 2001 comedy <em class="emphasis">Zoolander</em>. In his continued effort to be the most cutting-edge designer in the fashion industry, Mugatu developed a new line of clothing inspired “by the streetwalkers and hobos that surround us.” His new product line, Derelicte, characterized by dresses made of burlap and parking cones and pants made of garbage bags and tin cans, was developed for customers who valued the uniqueness of his…eclectic design. Emphasizing unique products is typical of a company following a differentiation strategy; however, Mugatu targeted a very specific set of customers. Few people would probably be enticed to wear garbage for the sake of fashion. By catering to a niche target market, Mugatu went from a simple differentiation strategy to a focused differentiation. Mugatu’s Derelicte campaign in <em class="emphasis">Zoolander</em> is one illustration of how a particular firm might develop a focused differentiation strategy.</p>
