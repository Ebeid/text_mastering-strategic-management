    <p class="para editable block" id="ketchen_1.0-ch07_s05_p01">This chapter explains competition in international markets. Executives must consider the benefits and risks of competing internationally when making decisions about whether to expand overseas. Executives also need to determine the likelihood that their firms will succeed when they compete in international markets by examining demand conditions, factor conditions, related and supporting industries, and strategy, structure, and rivalry among its domestic competitors. When a firm does venture overseas, a decision must be made about whether its international strategy will be multidomestic, global, or transnational. Finally, when leading a firm to enter a new market, executives can choose to manage the operation via exporting, creating a wholly owned subsidiary, franchising, licensing, and creating a joint venture or strategic alliance.</p>
